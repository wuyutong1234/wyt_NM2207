## NM2207 final project

### dairy entry (also found in Week 9-12 file)

## *week 9*

**What is the topic that I have finalized**

I will be conducting an analysis of **insomnia** data with the aim of offering a succinct overview sleep difficulties. The goal is to provide users and viewers of the interactive data with a sense of connection at the demographic level and to inspire them with a range of coping techniques.

**What are the data sources that I have curated so far?**

I will be examining the primary factors that lead to insomnia, exploring its effects on health, and evaluating the effectiveness of coping strategies, all while considering variations across different age groups and genders.

## *week 10*

**What is the question that I am going to answer?**

What is the gender and age disparity in insomnia (severity, causes and coping skills) in young adults?

**Why is this an important question?**

Sleep is a fundamental component of our lives, intricately linked to our mental well-being and daily functioning (NIH, 2022). Nevertheless, the issue of insomnia has risen to concerning levels, with a significant increase in sleep-related problems observed in young adults, going from 22.6% in 2010 to 30.5% in 2018 (Sivertsen, B. et al, 2019). In contrast to the commonly held belief that older adults experience more sleep difficulties than their younger counterparts, research indicates that insomnia affects over 1 in 4 individuals aged 18 to 24, with 29% experiencing it every night, making this age group the most vulnerable in the United States (Helsestart, 2022). Through an examination of the underlying causes of insomnia across different age groups and genders, we can unveil the distinctive challenges that this population faces today and explore effective approaches to address these concerns.

**Which rows and columns of the dataset will be used to answer this question?**

All rows with valid data entry are used (86 rows after data cleaning).The columns used are categorised into 4 main groups: participants info, severity of insomnia, causes of insomnia and coping skills.

participants info: Group, SubGroup, Sex, Age

severity of insomnia: ISI_total

causes of insomnia: BDI_total, ASHS_total, ASHS_physiological, ASHS_cognitive,ASHS_emotional, ASHS_SleepEnvirnmont, ASHS_DaytimeSleep, ASHS_substances, ASHS_bedtimeRoutine, ASHS_sleepStability, ASHS_BedroomSharing, DBAS_total, FIRST_total, GCTI_total, NEO_neuroticism, NEO_extraversion, NEO_openness, NEO_agreeableness, NEO_Conscientiousness, ACE_tot, asq_home, asq_school, asq_attendance, asq_romantic, asq_peer, asq_teacher, asq_future, asq_leisure, asq_finance, asq_responsibility

coping skills: cope_disengage_su, cope_growth, cope_disengage_mental, cope_emotions, cope_socialsupp_instr, cope_active, cope_denial, cope_religion, cope_humor, cope_disengage_emo, cope_restraint, cope_socialsupp_emo, cope_acccept, cope_suppression, cope_planning

**The challenges and errors that I faced and how I overcame them.**

challenge 1: unable to publicise the app (when all workings on data cleaning and graph plotting is done on a R markdown file, app.R can still show on local host because information required is found in the workspace. However, when trying to publicise the app, it will not work)

solution: transfer all codes, including library(tidyverse), read.csv(), and data cleaning to app.R file so that when running the app, data files can be accessed.

challenge 2: for my eventual data visualisation, I need to use a lot of variables from the data set and a lot of them have specific qualities which make it very messy to manipulate them

solution: I tried to regroup and recategorise them by assigning 4 big titles: participants, sleep quality, casues, and coping skills; subsequently creating 4 different datasets. Within each group, there are also smaller groups like ASHS_total (Adolescent Sleep Hygiene Scale) and distinct categories of ASHS (eg. cognitive domain, emotional domain). I will further organise them by creating subgroups of data.

## *week 11*

**The visualizations that I are going to use in your project**

[First group of visualisation]{.underline}: I am going to plot age (Age) and gender (Sex) against severity of insomnia (ISI_total).

-   Age-severity of insomnia: line plot

-   Gender-severity of insomnia: bar plot

[Second group of visualisation:]{.underline}

analyse causes of insomnia (BDI_total, ASHS_total, ASHS_physiological, ASHS_cognitive,ASHS_emotional, ASHS_SleepEnvirnmont, ASHS_DaytimeSleep, ASHS_substances, ASHS_bedtimeRoutine, ASHS_sleepStability, ASHS_BedroomSharing, DBAS_total, FIRST_total, GCTI_total, ACE_tot, asq_home, asq_school, asq_attendance, asq_romantic, asq_peer, asq_teacher, asq_future, asq_leisure, asq_finance, asq_responsibility)

depression (BDI_total) -severity of insomnia: scatter plot

sleep hygiene (ASHS_total) -severity of insomnia: scatter plot

rank all sleep hygiene factors (ASHS_physiological, ASHS_cognitive,ASHS_emotional, ASHS_SleepEnvirnmont, ASHS_DaytimeSleep, ASHS_substances, ASHS_bedtimeRoutine, ASHS_sleepStability, ASHS_BedroomSharing): histogram

predisposition to insomnia - severity of insomnia: scatter plot

dysfunctional beliefs - severity of insomnia: scatter plot

cognitive instrusiveness - severity of insomnia: scatter plot

rank all stress factors (asq_home, asq_school, asq_attendance, asq_romantic, asq_peer, asq_teacher, asq_future, asq_leisure, asq_finance, asq_responsibility): histogram

word cloud of all the causes of insomnia

Third group of visualisation: compare effectiveness of coping skills - pie chart

**How do I plan to make it interactive?** \*\*ggplot2\*\*: to plot the graphs (scatter plot, histogram, bar plot, etc.)

\*\*shiny\*\*: 1. create drop down bar for the viewer to select the specific factor he/she wants to focus at; 2. wordcloud to give a visual representation of the causes of insomnia

\*\*plotly, gganimate, transformr\*\*: to make the graph mroe interactive portray a clearer story (eg. highlight the highest point on graph)

**the challenges and errors that you faced and how I overcame them**

**challenge 3** Initially, I wanted to show the ranking of causes of insomnia using histogram but when after data manipulation, I realised that the causes of insomnia are measured not on a consistent scale. Therefore, comparing all causes in a single graph is not valid.

**solution** I decided to separate the data sets and regroup the causes into depression, sleep hygiene, predisposition, dysfunctional beliefs, cognitive intrusiveness. My focus is now changed to display their association with insomnia.

## *week 12*

**the challenges and errors that you faced and how I overcame them**

**challenge 4** When trying to make the plot more asthetic, I faced difficulty trying to customise the x-axis label as as there are 5 plots in the function and I don\'t know how to change x-axis label for each plot.

**solution** instead of modifying the function of the app, I renamed the variable to the desired x-axis label. This is easier way to achieve my desired outcome.

**challenge 5** The initial plan to use word cloud and animation is not actualised as when trying out the visualisation, the display is not clear and defeats the purpose of making the message clear to the viewers.

**solution** Instead of word cloud and animation on the plots, I chose to make the ideas concise by using simple widgets (eg. radial button).
