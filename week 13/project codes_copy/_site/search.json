    "text": "I’m Yutong, a psychology student at the National University of Singapore (NUS). As an aspiring psychologist, I’m passionate about understanding the complexities of the human mind and using that knowledge to make a positive impact on people’s lives.\nMy personality type is INFJ, which means I’m not only empathetic but also driven to help and support others in their personal growth and well-being. This innate quality fuels my dedication to my studies and my future career in psychology.\nWhen I’m not immersed in my academic pursuits, I find joy in the art of dance and the magic of movies. Dance allows me to express myself creatively and stay physically active, while movies offer a window into different worlds and human experiences. Both of these passions provide a delightful escape and a source of inspiration in my life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 + 1\n\n[1] 2"
